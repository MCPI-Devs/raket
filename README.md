# Raket
A simple and low-level Minecraft Pi server.

**Warning**: This is a Work In Progress, it is not guaranteed to work.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
To use Raket you need to have `Python >= 3.7.x` pre-installed.

### Installation
To install the server, download or clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/MCPI-Devs/raket.git
```
There are no aditional requirements.

## Usage
Run the `raket.py` (**not** `rak.py`) file in the root of the repo as
```shell
python3 raket.py
```
That command should start a server in `localhost:19134`.

## Features
 + RakNet server (handshake, log-in, etc.).
 + **WIP**: Basic MCPI server.
 + **WIP**: Configuration file.
 + **TODO**: Plug-in system.
